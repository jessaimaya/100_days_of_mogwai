# 100DaysOfMogwai
Inspired by [100daysofcode](https://www.100daysofcode.com/) I'll try to make a mix from [James Huber's post](https://dev.to/jwhubert91) on [dev.to](https://dev.to/jwhubert91/100-days-of-react-1h5d) and [Florin Pop](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/author/florinpop17/) on his [100 Projects](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-i-built-100-projects-in-100-days/), using [Mogwai](https://crates.io/crates/mogwai).

I know that A is, by far, more popular in the front-end ecosystem in rust, nevertheless, I think that using mogwai I could learn more about JS bindings and the way everything is connected, it's more verbose, but usually, I don't like magic happening everywhere.
