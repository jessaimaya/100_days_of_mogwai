# 100DaysOfMogwai
Inpired by [100daysofcode](https://www.100daysofcode.com/) and [James Huber's post](https://dev.to/jwhubert91) on [dev.to](https://dev.to/jwhubert91/100-days-of-react-1h5d) I'll try to mimic his path on the way to learn React, but usign [Mogwai](https://crates.io/crates/mogwai).

I know that A is, by far, more popular in the front-end ecosystem in rust, nevertheless, I think that using mogwai I could learn more about JS bindings and the way everything is connected, it's more verbose, but usually, I don't like magic happening everywhere.
